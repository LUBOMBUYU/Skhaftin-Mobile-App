## Key Components

- **Screens.kt**: All composable UI screens (Login, Register, Home, etc.)
- **MainActivity.kt**: Main activity handling navigation
- **DataRepository.kt**: Central data access point
- **UserViewModel.kt**: User authentication and profile management

## Building and Running

### Debug Build
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Release Build
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Run Tests
```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Run on Device
```bash
./gradlew installDebug
```

## System Architecture

### MVVM Architecture Pattern
The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, ensuring separation of concerns and testability:

- **Model**: Data classes and business logic (User, Item, Message models)
- **View**: Jetpack Compose UI components (Screens.kt, composables)
- **ViewModel**: State management and business logic (UserViewModel, ItemViewModel)

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger events in ViewModels
2. ViewModels communicate with Repository layer
3. Repository handles data operations (local Room DB and remote Firebase)
4. Data changes are observed via LiveData/Flow and update the UI

### Offline-First Design
- Local Room database for offline data storage
- Firebase synchronization when online
- Conflict resolution for data consistency

## Database Design

### Firebase Firestore Schema
```
users/{userId}
├── name: String
├── email: String
├── location: String
├── preferredLanguage: String
└── impact: Impact object

items/{itemId}
├── name: String
├── quantity: String
├── description: String
├── location: String
├── imageUrl: String
├── ownerId: String
├── uniqueCode: String
└── timestamp: Timestamp

chats/{chatId}
├── participants: Array<String>
├── lastMessage: String
└── timestamp: Timestamp

messages/{messageId}
